# HistoryLens — Time Travel with Your Photos

## Problem Statement
HistoryLens empowers users to reimagine their photos across time. By leveraging Google Gemini 2.5 Flash Image, users can upload a selfie, object, or location and instantly see it transformed into different historical eras (Ancient, Medieval, Futuristic) or even future imaginings. The app enables natural-language edits (e.g., "add Roman soldiers to the background") and produces narrated slideshow videos using ElevenLabs TTS. This unlocks creative storytelling, education, and fun for all ages—no technical skills required.
